# Neighborhood Map App
An interactive map displaying interesting places in Sendai City, Miyagi, Japan. Click on the menu of interesting places on the left side of the screen to select a marker on the map. Under those buttons is a filter, with which you can filter the list by category (e.g. 'education', 'leisure', etc.)
Created for the Udacity Neighborhood Map project.

## Getting Started

### Building the program:
(This step should not be necessary to simply run the app. If you edit the program you will need to do this to create the dist files again.)
1. Install grunt by typing `npm install -g grunt-cli` into the terminal.
2. `cd` into the 'neighborhood-map' folder.
3. Type `grunt` into the terminal to create the 'dist' files.

### Running the program:
1. Run the program using python2.7 to start a basic server by typing `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` into the terminal.
2. `cd` into the 'neighborhood-map/dist' folder from the terminal.
3. Navigate in your browser to the server you created (http://localhost:8000). You should see the map.

## Built With:
- Foursquare API
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Google Maps API
